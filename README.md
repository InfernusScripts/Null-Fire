Welcome, welcome! Don't be afraid, im not gonna hurt you!...

It is a project I'm making for fun.
It been created not to become popular or something, I made it for myself and just wanted to share it with you.
I did not expect it to become THAT popular, thank you very much, guys!

The ONLY and REAL NullFire loadstring is
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfernusScripts/Null-Fire/main/Loader"))()
```
