I did not expect it to become THAT popular, thank you very much, guys!

## History
At first there was no such thing as NullFire - there was FireDoors.
Yeah, it was a small Doors script before.

After lolhax leaked infinite crucifix method it gave me a huge headstart.

I worked very hard on it and made a script of size about 3000-4000 lines of code!
Then I realised that I want FireDoors to support more than 1 game, so I renamed it to FireDoors.


...


After a while I got sick of Doors and rarely joined that game (btw, same happened with Pressure, but about that later).

Doors script was discontinued.

After a break that lasted about 2 years I started developing FireDoors again.
I made a known script called "FireHub - Pressure".
Then I made a Funky Friday one and Natural Disaster Survival.

After collabing with seikoso FireHub turned into a NullFire (btw, I like that name).

I updated Pressure script really lot, so there was no other scripts that could do better than me.
And because of that I also got sick of Pressure (+ got banned).

At this moment (8th of may 2025) NullFire - Pressure is about to be discontinued, but I think I will still do some updates, just not that fast.

A bit later the game called "Dead Rails" became ultra popular.
I decided to make a script for it.

NullFire for Dead Rails became EVEN MORE POPULAR THAN PRESSURE (#2 popular dead rails script for Dead Rails on ScriptBlox; 8th of may 2025).
I'm really proud of it.

## DEVELOPERS ZONE

NullFire is mostly open source project, so I even made documentations!
You can use any of NullFire's libraries or copy it's / their code, I don't mind.
You can read about libraries [here](https://github.com/InfernusScripts/Null-Fire/blob/main/Documentations/README.md), I'm trying to update these right after releasing updates for them.
