# NullFire
Welcome, welcome! Don't be afraid, im not gonna hurt you!...

It is a project I'm making for fun.
It been created not to become popular or something, I made it for myself and just wanted to share it with you.
I did not expect it to become THAT popular, thank you very much, guys!

The ONLY and REAL NullFire loadstring is

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfernusScripts/Null-Fire/main/Loader"))()

```

Thanks for using my script(s)!

NullFire is mostly open source project, so I even made documentations!
You can use any of NullFire's library or copy it's code, I don't mind
You can read about libraries [here](https://github.com/InfernusScripts/Null-Fire/blob/main/Documentations/README.md), I'm trying to update these right after releasing updates for them
